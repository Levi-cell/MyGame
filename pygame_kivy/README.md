# Pygame Kivy Project

Welcome to the Pygame Kivy Project repository! This project consists of three separate components: a Pygame-based game, a Kivy learning lab, and a Kivy-based game app. Each component serves a unique purpose and showcases different aspects of Python game development using these libraries.

## Files

### 1. Pygame File - SpaceInvaders

- **File Name:** `invaders.py`
- **Description:** This file contains a Pygame-based game application. It features a space-invaders style game where the player controls a spaceship to shoot down invading aliens. The game includes graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and score tracking.

### 2. Kivy Learning Lab

- **File Name:** `kivy_lab.ipy`
- **Description:** This file serves as a learning lab for Kivy, an open-source Python library for developing interactive applications. The code includes explanations, code snippets, and exercises to help you understand Kivy's features and concepts. Below is a code snippet from the lab:

### 3. Kivy Game App
- ** File Name **: main.py
- ** Description **: This file contains a Kivy game application. The game, titled "Galaxy," involves navigating a ship through a tunnel-like environment. It showcases Kivy's graphics, animation, and user input handling capabilities. The app includes perspective transformations, audio integration, and gameplay mechanics.

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.

2. Dependencies: Install the required libraries for each component:

- For the Pygame component, run pip install pygame.
- For the Kivy component, run pip install kivy.

3. Running the Pygame Game: Execute the Pygame game by running python invaders.py.

4. Exploring Kivy Learning Lab: Open the kivy_lab.py, TheLab.kv  file to learn about Kivy concepts and features.

5. Running the Kivy Game App: Run the Kivy game app by executing python main.py.


Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the provided code files. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to seek assistance.

Enjoy the journey of game development, interactive application creation, and learning Kivy! ðŸš€
